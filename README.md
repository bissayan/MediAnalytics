# MediAnalytics
A Power BI and Python-based Data Analytics project for a B2C real Medicine Store. Combines multiple datasets (purchases, users, medicines) to perform sales insights, Pareto analysis, statistical tests, and machine learning for churn prediction and delivery expansion analysis. Interactive dashboards with DAX enable month &amp; region filters

## Project Overview  
MediAnalytics is a **data analytics and machine learning project** that integrates a one year  real b2c medicine store dataset to uncover business insights.  
It combines **Power BI dashboards** for interactive visualization and **ML models** to identify medicine side-effects and prevalent diseases across localities.  

## Features  
-  **Sales Analytics Dashboard** – Top-selling medicines by month, region, and age group.  
-  **Geospatial Insights** – Map of medicine sales by locality.  
-  **Pareto Analysis** – 80/20 rule to identify medicines contributing most to revenue.  
-  **Machine Learning** – Customer Churn Prediction, Delivery Exapansion Analysis,and Testing Discount Bucket.  
-  **Dynamic Filters** – Interactive slicers (month, region, age group) that update all visuals in real time.  

  

## Tech Stack  
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI (DAX queries, slicers, KPI cards, clustered column chart, maps)  
- **Machine Learning**: ScikitLearn(Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), Statictical Testing
- **Database**: Excel sheets (purchases, users, medicines)
